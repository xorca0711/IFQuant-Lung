// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// The route model, the environment surface, and the fail-closed gate.
//
// This file contains NO WinForms code and NO measurement code. Everything
// here is a decision or a description; IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy remains the
// only thing that measures, and it is frozen.
//
// It is compiled together with IFQuantLauncher.cs and
// MainForm.Routes.partial.cs into a single assembly (launcher/build.ps1).
// It is ALSO compiled standalone, without WinForms, into the legacy
// equivalence harness, which is how route 4 is proven by execution rather
// than by assertion. Do not add a WinForms dependency to this file.
//
// THE FOUR ROUTES
//   R1  IF - confocal / field images     Fiji only. v1.7.2 behaviour + gates.
//   R2  IF - slide scanner (.vsi)        QuPath stage 1 -> Fiji -> stage 3.
//   R3  H&E / brightfield                DISABLED. See LauncherBuild below.
//   R4  Fiji-only legacy                 Byte-identical v1.7.2 environment.
//
// THE HAZARDS THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE BY ACCIDENT
//   H1  IFQ_PANEL defaults to "T"              IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy:154
//   H2  no fixed threshold -> per-region Otsu  IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy:2132-2140
//   H3  IFQ_MIN_INCLUDED_NUCLEI defaults to 1  IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy:329
//   H4  a non-empty IFQ_OUTPUT_DIR aborts      IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy:3479-3484
//   H5  an unfrozen run must say so in writing (this launcher's record)
