    build.ps1 -- IF Quant Launcher v1.9.4

    Diff against the v1.7.2 build script, in full:

      1. THREE source files are compiled instead of one. csc takes a list, so
         nothing about the shape of the build changes; the launcher is still a
         single self-contained .exe with no external dependencies.
      2. TWO extra resources are embedded: qupath_wsi_tile_export.groovy and
         aggregate_tiles_to_slide.py. Route 2 needs them on an analysis machine
         with no repository checkout, for exactly the reason v1.7.2 embedded the
         pipeline. Both are optional at run time, so a build made without them
         still starts and simply has no working route 2.
      3. The compiler search adds FrameworkArm64. v1.7.2 looked only in
         Framework64 and Framework; on a win-arm64 machine Framework64 exists
         and works under emulation, so v1.7.2 builds -- but that is luck.
      4. --self-test is RUN as part of the build and the binary is discarded on
         failure. v1.7.2 shipped a self-test and never ran it.

    Unchanged: AnyCPU, /target:winexe, the app.manifest, the versioned output
    name parsed out of AssemblyFileVersion, and the .sha256.txt sidecar written
    beside the exe in the repository root.
