# Development and AI assistance

Claude Code was used extensively for implementation, debugging, testing, and
documentation. **Scientific questions, experimental interpretation, analysis
specifications, acceptance and rejection criteria, validation strategy, and final
interpretation were directed and reviewed by me.**

This is visible in the git history — many commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude`
— and it is not concealed. The AI could implement and calculate; it was not the
authority on biological identity, experimental validity, or whether a result
warranted belief.

| Responsibility | Primary authority |
|---|---|
| Biological question and experimental interpretation | **Me** |
| Statistical unit and which comparisons are valid | **Me** |
| Acceptance / rejection criteria | **Me** |
| Endpoint definition and interpretation | **Me** |
| Implementation, refactoring, diagnostic code | AI-assisted |
| Documentation and diagrams | AI-assisted |
| Verification strategy | Author-directed, computationally executed |
| Final retain / reject decision | **Me** |

## Five decisions that shaped the result

### 1 · The mouse is the statistical unit, not fields or cells

The pipeline reports ~20,000 cells from four animals. Treating those as the
sample size would inflate confidence by roughly √(cells per mouse) and
manufacture significance from a single animal.

I specified the animal as the unit. `aggregate_to_mouse.py` enforces the roll-up
and prints the distinct-animal count, and the constraint is restated wherever a
number is reported.

### 2 · Thresholds locked from uninfected controls, before test data was evaluated

A cutoff chosen to separate the groups being compared is not a measurement of
those groups. I required intensity cutoffs to be re-derived from the uninfected
controls only, then frozen before infected animals were measured.

`IFQ_KRT5_THRESHOLD = 300` comes from the two controls alone (in-tissue
p99.99 = 283 and 255), giving control false-positive area ≤ 1e-4 in each
independently. Infected tissue then measured 8.1 % of area above 500.

I also accepted the cost: AGER and T1α are expressed in healthy lung, so no such
anchor exists for them. Those cutoffs remain adaptive and everything derived from
them is labelled `adaptive_otsu_exploratory` rather than reported as a result.

### 3 · AGER and KRT8 rejected when the data failed the pre-specified criterion

Both were tested with a control-locked enrichment ratio (R = infected fraction ÷
control fraction beyond the same cut), and both failed:

| Marker | R | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| AGER as a co-negativity marker | 0.99–1.05 | Retracted — the exclusion was definitional, not biological |
| KRT8 as a discriminator | 0.80–1.25 at every cut | Rejected — infected animals *bracket* the controls |

The AGER retraction reversed a marker I had chosen earlier. I kept both on the
record rather than deleting them, so neither gets re-derived.

### 4 · No genotype-level inference from a four-mouse design

One animal per genotype × condition cell means genotype is confounded with
condition: the difference between the two infected animals cannot be separated
from the difference between those two animals.

I decided this is prohibitive rather than a caveat to soften. The measurement
behaves as expected and the infected/uninfected contrast is near-binary, but no
statistical comparison of groups is supportable from this batch.

### 5 · Endpoint corrected against the primary source

The implementation computed KRT5⁺PDPN⁻. The reference specifies

> "percentages of **KRT5⁺PDPN⁺** areas in PDPN⁻ and KRT5⁺ areas"
> — Lin et al. 2024, *J Clin Invest* 134(19):e176828, Fig 2A–B

PDPN is expressed by dysplastic cells as well as AT1, so requiring
PDPN-negativity had been excluding the population being measured. The denominator
is also a hand-traced region union, not a computed density map — which retired a
detector that had been solving a problem the reference does not pose.

I required the evaluator to **refuse** the corrected specification rather than
divide by a denominator it cannot construct and exit successfully.

## Further examples

**Cell-type identity.** The 488 channel showed a bright, continuous band lining
the airway. I identified it as basal/club lineages rather than AT2, and specified
that genuine AT2 have circular perinuclear-granular morphology rather than a ring.
That led to a measurement settling it: ProSPC intensity is p50 = 430 inside AT2
against 385 in the airway — nearly identical, so no intensity threshold separates
them and the difference is extent, not brightness.

**Bench-to-computation feedback overriding automated QC.** A staining failure in
one animal (M6) was identified at the bench by my PI. No in-image statistic had
flagged it; it was confirmed afterwards in the data (AGER `frac>500` = 0.0097 in
the LEFT section against 0.289 in the RIGHT, same antibody, same animal). The
consequence is carried forward: the KRT5 cutoff in practice rests on one clean
control, not two.

**Refusing an analysis that would have looked better.** A rolling-ball background
subtraction was proposed to remove the non-specific airway population. I rejected
it because the filter radius was being chosen for making the unwanted content
disappear — a repeat of an error already retired from the codebase. A merge panel
may not delete image content; suppression belongs to the QC overlay, where it is
visibly an analysis decision.

## AI-produced work was not accepted automatically

Consequential examples:

- **A single-field statistic quoted as a batch result** — 185 → 16,422 (89×)
  came from one field and was presented as the batch figure. The pooled value is
  152.5 → 15,393.3 (~101×). Corrected everywhere, with the estimator now named.
- **An image-manipulation proposal** — background subtraction tuned to remove a
  population (above), and before it a connected-component gate that deleted the
  airway from a panel presented as a micrograph. Both retired; a configuration
  still requesting the gate now fails.
- **Over-aggressive display processing** — marker channels erased twice by floors
  derived from pooled statistics and applied per image, where each section's
  ceiling is lower.
- **Implementation defects exposed by validation** — outputs named from bare
  filenames silently overwrote 8 of 80 panels while the log reported 80; a
  `>127` mask test rendered nothing for label images with fewer than 128 objects.

## How work was verified

| Method | Applied to |
|---|---|
| Execution-based equivalence | Launcher legacy mode — 84 checks against what a *real child process* receives |
| Mutation testing | 28 mutants of the launcher's decision logic; 26 killed, 2 intentional controls |
| Replay to bit-identity | The segmentation defect, reproduced at **IoU = 1.0000** |
| Synthetic fixture | Same defect, demonstrable from a clone with no data |
| Regression measurement | Area outputs after the engine fix — *measured* unchanged (worst 0.0209 pp), not assumed |
| Held-out / control-locked validation | Thresholds derived on controls, applied to infected animals not used in derivation |
| Independent re-running | Agent-produced results re-executed before being retained |

Two are executable by a reader from a clean clone:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./validation/run_demo.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./launcher/run_legacy_equivalence.ps1
```

[MIT](LICENSE), covering the software and documentation. Deliberately scoped:
it does not extend to microscopy image data (none is committed), to the
third-party tools this pipeline invokes, or to unpublished scientific findings —
reuse of the code is granted, reuse of the results follows normal academic
citation.

AI use in this repository is visible and documented. The question I would want a
reviewer to ask is not whether an AI coding agent was used, but whether
scientific control and accountability were retained while using one — and the
specifications, rejections, retractions, and preserved negative results above are
the evidence I would offer.
