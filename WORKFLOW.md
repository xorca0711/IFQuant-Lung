# Active Quantification and Marker Morphology Workflow

This is the primary operational and interpretation reference for the current
morphology-first Fiji/ImageJ pipeline. Final marker calls are determined by
role-appropriate spatial morphology. Mean intensity is retained for audit, but
it does not authorize a positive or negative call.

The numeric morphology settings below are conservative pilot defaults, not
universal biological cutoffs. Derive intensity cutoffs and validate morphology
parameters using blinded negative and positive controls, then freeze them before
comparing experimental groups.

## Universal marker-selection hierarchy

Before analyzing a new marker set, freeze these layers in order:

1. Research question and biological unit: lineage, transient state,
   localization, regional burden, or spatial relationship.
2. Species, preparation, modality, antibody clone, and known controls.
3. Blinded anatomical/context ROIs.
4. A lineage anchor, state marker, and nearest-alternative/exclusion marker.
5. Analytical role: nuclear, nuclear ratio, cytoplasmic, membrane, apical
   cilia, or regional area.
6. Channel map and projection policy for the actual acquisition.
7. Control-derived intensity cutoff and validated morphology/size gates.

Marker identity, image channel, analytical geometry, and biological
interpretation are separate. A marker registry entry may supply a geometry
default, but it never assigns a disease diagnosis or a final cell identity.
Unknown markers remain supported when the custom panel declares their role.

For the newly expanded profiles: KRT8 uses connected cytoplasmic filament
support; ITGA2/CD49b uses connected membrane support; SOX9 requires connected
DAPI-nuclear enrichment; and PDGFRB is preferably a regional/perivascular area
endpoint at 20x, with per-nucleus membrane calls reserved for validated
high-resolution ownership. Red2-Kras uses connected cytoplasmic RFP reporter
support with clone area primary at 20x; RFP-positive marks the verified
oncogene-coupled clone, whereas RFP-negative alone is not a wild-type call.
Pan-KRAS uses connected cytoplasmic/inner-membrane protein support but does not
imply a KRAS mutation. Ki-67/MKI67 uses connected nuclear enrichment and is
summarized as a labeling index inside a predeclared population or ROI. `IGTA2`
is accepted as an alias of canonical `ITGA2`. Except for the construct-linked
Red2-Kras RFP interpretation, none of these markers assigns a lineage,
mutation, malignancy, or disease state by itself.

## Decision authority and three-state semantics

The authoritative cell call is `<marker>_final_call`:

- `1`: morphology-positive;
- `0`: evaluable morphology-negative;
- blank: indeterminate because the marker could not be evaluated safely.

Classification and summary endpoints consume this field. The legacy object-mean
field `<marker>_pos` is audit-only.

This hierarchy has three important consequences:

1. A high object mean alone cannot produce a final positive.
2. A low object mean does not force a negative when a thin or localized
   structure has sufficient connected pixels above the cutoff.
3. Missing spatial information is indeterminate, not negative. Segmentation
   failure, ambiguous ownership, invalid projection, or an unassigned required
   compartment must not silently inflate the negative group.

For every cell-call marker with `expectedCompartment` or
`expectedCompartments`, context is asymmetric:

- strict localization-correct marker evidence may be retained as an
  `exploratory_positive_context_unresolved` call when anatomy is unassigned or
  ambiguous;
- absence becomes negative only inside a compatible, independently assigned
  compartment;
- evidence in a known incompatible compartment remains indeterminate for the
  intended endpoint and is separately counted as
  `<marker>_context_excluded_evidence_positive_count`;
- context-unresolved positives cannot authorize compound lineage/state
  classifications.

This preserves observable marker expression without allowing the marker channel
to declare its own negative population or anatomical identity. A custom channel
can set `allowPositiveWithoutCompartment: false` when even marker positivity is
not interpretable without geography.

Adaptive Otsu thresholds are allowed for pilot exploration and produce
`exploratory_positive` or `exploratory_negative` status. Confirmatory analysis
requires a fixed cutoff declared from appropriate controls before analysis.

## Morphology gate definitions

For each marker-specific support region, the pipeline calculates:

- **Positive fraction:** fraction of support pixels at or above the resolved
  marker cutoff.
- **Largest-component share:** fraction of positive pixels belonging to the
  largest 8-connected component. This rejects scattered bright specks.
- **Localization:** nuclear enrichment for p63/Sox2, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio
  for YAP, or the appropriate perinuclear/apical support for other roles.
- **Ownership:** whether another included nucleus lies inside support that is
  meant to belong uniquely to the current cell. Shared support is indeterminate.
- **Compartment/context:** whether the marker is evaluated in a compatible
  airway, alveolar, tumor, fibrotic, stromal, vascular, or immune ROI. Multiple
  tags can coexist in one ROI name.

A final positive is the logical AND of all applicable gates. A final negative is
allowed only when the marker is evaluable.

## Current pilot morphology matrix

| Marker | Expected role and analytical support | Minimum positive fraction | Minimum largest-component share | Additional gate or primary readout |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| KRT5 | Perinuclear cytoplasmic ring | 0.20 | 0.50 | Unique ownership; independent pod area is also reported |
| AGER | Membrane-support ring | 0.25 | 0.40 | Alveolar ROI; unique ownership; membrane area also reported |
| PDPN | Membrane-support ring | 0.25 | 0.40 | Alveolar ROI; unique ownership; membrane area also reported |
| T1A | Membrane-support ring | 0.30 | 0.40 | Alveolar ROI; unique ownership; membrane area also reported |
| mRAGE | Membrane-support ring | 0.30 | 0.40 | Alveolar ROI; unique ownership; membrane area also reported |
| Pro-SPC | Perinuclear granular cytoplasm | 0.15 | 0.40 | Alveolar ROI; unique ownership |
| CD4/CD8 | Nucleus-associated membrane proxy | 0.20 | 0.40 | Unique ownership |
| Sox2 | DAPI nucleus | 0.40 | 0.60 | Nuclear:ring enrichment at least 1.25 |
| p63 | DAPI nucleus | 0.40 | 0.60 | Nuclear:ring enrichment at least 1.25 |
| YAP | DAPI nucleus plus cytoplasmic reference ring | 0.30 | 0.60 | Nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio at least 1.50; single plane |
| Aqp5 | Perinuclear support | 0.20 | 0.40 | Unique ownership |
| CC10/SCGB1A1 | Perinuclear secretory cytoplasm | 0.20 | 0.40 | Unique ownership |
| tdTomato | Perinuclear reporter support | 0.20 | 0.40 | Unique ownership; independent reporter area also reported |
| Acetylated tubulin | Unique nearest ciliary component in a 1-6 um apical shell | 0.10 | 0.30 | Contextual positive allowed if all gates pass; negative requires airway ROI; regional patches are primary at 20x |

The AcTub regional patch filter is 2.0 um2. The former 0.5 um2 filter was only
about five pixels at the tested 0.311 um/pixel calibration and was too permissive
for a structure-level endpoint.

## Marker-specific interpretation

### Nuclear markers: p63 and Sox2

Positive signal must occupy a substantial connected portion of the DAPI nucleus
and be enriched relative to the reference ring. This rejects isolated nuclear
specks and perinuclear blur that could raise a nucleus mean.

### Nuclear localization marker: YAP

YAP is a localization phenotype, not merely a nuclear-intensity marker. Require
both connected nuclear support and the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. Use a single
optical plane or a validated 3D workflow; maximum projection mixes different
depths and makes the ratio non-local.

### Cytoplasmic and reporter markers

KRT5, Pro-SPC, CC10, and tdTomato use a perinuclear ring because the nucleus is
not the expected signal compartment. Connected thresholded coverage is primary.
Whole-marker area remains important for dense KRT5 pods and tdTomato reporter
fields that cannot be represented reliably by one nucleus-centered measurement
per cell.

CC10 denotes current secretory protein phenotype; it does not prove club-cell
ancestry after injury. tdTomato denotes recombination history, not current cell
identity.

### Membrane markers

AGER, PDPN/T1A, mRAGE, CD4, and CD8 are membrane-associated. Their signal can be
thin and bright while the mean over a larger ring is low. Positive fraction and
connected-pattern gates are therefore more appropriate than ring mean alone.
AGER, PDPN/T1A, and mRAGE require alveolar anatomical context for the specified
AT1 interpretation. Regional membrane area and cell-associated calls answer
different questions and must be reported separately.

### Acetylated alpha-tubulin

AcTub is concentrated in apical cilia. At 20x, the primary endpoint is regional
ciliary-patch area and component distribution, not an individual-cilium count.
For a cellular association, accepted ciliary components (at least 2 um2) are
assigned to exactly one nearest nucleus. The component centroid must lie at
least 1 um outside the equivalent-radius nuclear boundary, no farther than the
6 um apical support shell, and the local support must pass both 0.10 coverage
and 0.30 connected-pattern gates.

This is an asymmetric decision. A nucleus satisfying all component and spatial
rules may be reported as
`exploratory_positive_cellular_context` when the whole field is unassigned or
ambiguous. Failure to find such a component is **not** an AcTub-negative call
without an independently defined airway ROI; it remains indeterminate. A known
non-airway ROI is never overridden by the target marker. Inside a validated
airway ROI, both positive and negative calls are allowed. Regional ciliary area
remains the primary 20x endpoint.

## Sectioning rules

### Optical sectioning

- One-plane acquisitions are analyzed as that plane.
- Maximum projection is acceptable for robust area measurements when validated.
- YAP nuclear:cytoplasmic analysis requires a representative single plane or a
  validated 3D method.
- Apical cilia are best assessed in a single apical plane or restricted apical Z
  range when a stack is available.

The tested G002 and G003 Olympus OIR files each contain one optical section, so
no marker-specific Z projection is needed for those files.

### Anatomical sectioning

Draw ROIs without consulting the target marker channel. The supported
anatomical/context tags are:

| Tag/state | Short description |
|---|---|
| `airway` | Conducting-airway or bronchiolar anatomy; names containing `airway` or `bronch` |
| `alveolar` | Distal gas-exchange parenchyma; names containing `alveol` |
| `tumor` | Histologically/experimentally defined tumor region; `tumor`, `tumour`, or `luad` |
| `fibrotic` | Scarred/remodeled, honeycomb, or UIP-pattern region; `fibrot`, `honeycomb`, or `uip` |
| `stromal` | Mesenchymal/connective-tissue region; `strom` or `mesench` |
| `vascular` | Vessel/capillary-associated region; `vascul`, `vessel`, or `capillar` |
| `immune` | Immune-rich/inflammatory/lymphoid region; `immune`, `inflamm`, or `lymph` |
| `ambiguous` | Mixed or uncertain anatomy; it never authorizes a negative |
| `unassigned` | No recognized tag and no override; missing context, not negative/background |

The pipeline exports all recognized labels as `region_tags`, while
`compartment` remains a single backward-compatible primary label. A panel can
accept any of several tags through `expectedCompartments`.

Multiple tags may coexist, such as `alveolar_fibrotic_01` or
`tumor_stromal_02`. Decisions use the complete `region_tags` set. The display
field `compartment` uses `ambiguous > alveolar > airway > unassigned > first
other tag` precedence. If `ambig` occurs anywhere in the ROI name, all other
tags are intentionally discarded.

For study runs:

```powershell
$env:IFQ_COMPARTMENT_MODE = 'required'
```

An unrecognized or ambiguous required compartment produces indeterminate calls
for compartment-dependent markers.

For a visually reviewed, anatomically homogeneous field only,
`IFQ_WHOLE_FIELD_COMPARTMENT` can record any supported explicit context
(`airway`, `alveolar`, `tumor`, `fibrotic`, `stromal`, `vascular`, `immune`, or
`ambiguous`) in provenance. Never force a mixed field into one compartment;
draw separate ROIs or use `ambiguous` instead.

The complete tag definitions, analytical subcellular roles, ROI naming
examples, and image-to-call progression are in
[`docs/COMPARTMENT_TAGS_AND_PROGRESSION.md`](docs/COMPARTMENT_TAGS_AND_PROGRESSION.md).

### Analytical sectioning

Choose the unit that matches the biology: nucleus, perinuclear cytoplasmic ring,
membrane-support ring, independent positive-area mask, apical-cilia support, or
nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. These units are not interchangeable.

## Threshold and control policy

- Use unstained, secondary-only, or biological negative controls to estimate
  background and nonspecific signal.
- Use known positive tissue to verify that the threshold captures the expected
  structure rather than merely the brightest pixels.
- Derive fixed thresholds without consulting experimental group outcomes.
- Freeze threshold, minimum positive fraction, connectedness, minimum area,
  support width, projection, DAPI segmentation, and compartment rules before a
  cohort run.
- Keep all resolved parameters in `__params.json` and `run_manifest.json`.

Marker-specific overrides follow these patterns:

```powershell
$env:IFQ_CC10_THRESHOLD = 'control-derived-value'
$env:IFQ_CC10_MIN_POSITIVE_FRACTION = '0.20'
$env:IFQ_CC10_MIN_LARGEST_COMPONENT_SHARE = '0.40'
$env:IFQ_YAP_MIN_NUC_CYTO_RATIO = '1.50'
$env:IFQ_P63_MIN_NUCLEAR_ENRICHMENT = '1.25'
$env:IFQ_ACTUB_MIN_SUPPORT_FRACTION = '0.10'
$env:IFQ_ACTUB_MIN_PATCH_AREA_UM2 = '2.0'
```

Use `IFQ_<MARKER>_THRESHOLD` for a fixed cutoff. Non-alphanumeric characters are
removed from the environment token: `tdTOM` becomes `IFQ_TDTOM_THRESHOLD` and
`mRAGE` becomes `IFQ_MRAGE_THRESHOLD`.

## Minimal Fiji batch configuration

The recommended Windows route is
[`IFQuantLauncher-v1.4.1.exe`](IFQuantLauncher-v1.4.1.exe). It exposes the
directories and settings below in a GUI, creates a fresh timestamped output
folder, clears stale inherited `IFQ_*` variables, and chooses the appropriate
ARM64 or x64 Fiji launcher when a Fiji installation folder is selected.

For command-line or development runs, configure the same values manually:

```powershell
$env:IFQ_INPUT_DIR = 'G:\path\to\originals'
$env:IFQ_OUTPUT_DIR = "$PWD\analysis_output\run_name"
$env:IFQ_PANEL = 'E'
$env:IFQ_SEGMENTER = 'classic'
$env:IFQ_PROJECTION = 'max'
$env:IFQ_MARKER_REGISTRY = "$PWD\config\lung_marker_registry.json"
# For a new study: $env:IFQ_PANEL_CONFIG = 'D:\study\panels.json'
$env:IFQ_INCLUDE_REGEX = '.*A01_G002_0001.*'
$env:IFQ_MAX_IMAGES = '1'
$env:IFQ_MORPHOLOGY_PRIMARY = 'true'
```

Use a new, empty output directory for every run. A batch with no matching
images exits with code 1. Per-image failures are retained in `run_manifest.json`
and make the final manifest status `partial_failure` or `failed`; headless Fiji
also exits with code 1 after preserving the partial summary.

Run `IF_Quant_Pipeline.groovy` headlessly or through Fiji's Groovy script editor.
Every run must retain `run_manifest.json`, per-image `__params.json`, cell CSVs,
region summaries, decision masks, and call-QC PNGs. `run_summary.xlsx` opens on
**Image Positive Counts**, with one aligned row per image/region containing
total cells and every marker's final-positive cell count and fraction of that
row's total cells. The complete three-state audit remains on **Run Summary**,
and deliberate exclusions remain on **Skipped Inputs**. Microscope
`Map_A##.oir` navigation acquisitions are classified as deliberate skips
before analysis and do not make an otherwise successful run fail.

## Exported decision fields

The per-cell CSV includes:

- `<marker>_mean` and `<marker>_pos`: legacy mean-intensity audit values;
- `<marker>_support_fraction_above_threshold`;
- `<marker>_largest_positive_component_share`;
- `<marker>_fraction_pass`, `<marker>_connected_pattern_pass`,
  `<marker>_ownership_clear`, `<marker>_enrichment_pass`, and
  `<marker>_compartment_pass`;
- `<marker>_final_call`: `1`, `0`, or blank;
- `<marker>_call_status` and `<marker>_call_reason`;
- `<marker>_true_pos`: compatibility alias for the final call.

The region summary separately reports raw mean-intensity, morphology-positive,
morphology-negative, indeterminate, and evaluable counts. It also exports:

- nucleus-candidate acceptance and rejection fractions, with rejection reasons;
- marker positive/negative fractions among evaluable cells;
- marker indeterminate fractions among included nuclei;
- raw-intensity-positive/final-negative and
  raw-intensity-negative/final-positive disagreement counts;
- an intensity-morphology discordance fraction and a review-burden proxy
  (`indeterminate + discordant`) for longitudinal script QC.

These audit fractions are sensitivity and review-burden proxies, not validated
false-positive or false-negative rates. Classification rules use
`<marker>_final_call`, never `<marker>_pos`.

Every marker receives morphology-positive and indeterminate nuclei label masks,
plus a call-QC PNG with positive nuclei in green, evaluable negatives in cyan,
indeterminate nuclei in magenta, and the analysis ROI in orange.

## QC acceptance order

1. Confirm image identity, channel order, calibration, and projection.
2. Review DAPI candidate, accepted, rejected, split, and merged objects.
3. Confirm threshold boundaries follow the intended marker structure.
4. Confirm connected-support gates reject isolated bright specks.
5. Review call-QC images and verify spatially plausible positives.
6. Confirm shared support is not forced to a cell.
7. Confirm airway, alveolar, and ambiguous ROI labels are defensible.
8. Confirm no blank final call was converted to zero.
9. Freeze thresholds and morphology parameters before blinded group analysis.

## Statistical unit

Run:

```powershell
uv run --no-project python aggregate_to_mouse.py analysis_output\run_name\run_summary.csv
```

All inferential statistics use mouse-level rows. Sections, fields, regions, and
nuclei are not independent biological replicates.

## Current validation outputs

The two final local pilots are under `test_runs/current/`:

- `FinalPilot_CC10_AcTub_G002_morphology_primary_v2`;
- `FinalPilot_T1A_mRAGE_G002_morphology_primary_v2`.

These outputs are intentionally ignored by Git because they contain generated
images and tables. Their numerical results are preserved in
[`docs/PILOT_G002_MORPHOLOGY_RESULTS.md`](docs/PILOT_G002_MORPHOLOGY_RESULTS.md).
All reported calls and areas remain exploratory because the pilot used
image-specific Otsu thresholds.
